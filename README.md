# Testing - nightly testing for *MIRGE-Com*

This package is a general testing suite encapsulation useful for automating tests on remote platforms with resource management systems.  The package is demonstrated by implementing nightly testing for *MIRGE-Com* on Lassen.  More tests and platforms should be easy to add.  Test results should be reported in CI.
